epics
1. better menu for databank
- study dataset again button
3. have default databanks (search through by button, not editable?)
4. have more than 500 notifications / schedule next notification if old one is displayed
4. adds

- add a in progress icon of which word we currently learning (low prio)


PROBLEM
- find solution of how to change notification once it hits the max number
- increment notification nr key once notification gets triggered
- How to schedule changing notification content
	- schedule new notifications once old word is done
	- schedule new notification every time one is triggered
	- schedule notification every day


Notifications:
- debug them
- random testing of words (array of index)

Databases:
- import database from quizzlet
- import database from duolingo
- make database more than local


Down the line:
- create user profile
- server to store datasets & users
- adds


- automatically adapt font size depending on how much text we add
- new datapair also by clicking enter in last column
- new column: numbers shown
- add button, re-learn
- add option, num. of notifications for word
